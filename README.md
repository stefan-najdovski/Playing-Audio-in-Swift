# Playing-Audio-in-Swift
 Quick app I made to learn about how to play audio files on iPhone

# Tools used:
![Xcode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Xcode-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=Xcode&logoColor=white)

# Target platform:
![iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=ios&logoColor=white)

# What have I learned with this project:

- AVAudioPlayer (AVFoundation)
- Inserting sound files

# Note
- The Amogus meme asset is not mine and also the meme sounds amogus and ooof arent mine either, that is why the sound assets werent added in this repo, just add em to your liking :), I used them in the project for educational purposes only (to learn how to code and have fun along the way) .
For the logo/image its just a placeholder and/or meme. They belong to their respectable owners whoever they are in the ocean of information so called ***the internet***.
